       <hr><span> I have been flying since the age of 7. I started flying with my grandpa and uncle and this is where my spark ignited. Since then I have flown with many instructors and I have around 16 hours with an instructor. I am starting my ground school in April which will help me with getting my Priavte pilots licesnce. Iâ€™m hoping to go through the avation program at the legacy campus. I am also hoping to fly for united Airlines after high school as they have a good program and they pay well. </span><hr>
